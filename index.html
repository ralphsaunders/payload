                <p>Payload is a web publishing system for web designers &amp; developers. Systems like Wordpress are great for publishing blog posts, but when it comes to publishing advanced web pages with interactive infographics, graphs, and games, they fall apart. Payload aims to fix this.</p>

                    <p>Payload requires PHP version 5.1.6 or newer. Unzip
                    Payload in a directory on your server and you're good to go.</p>

                <h1 class="pl-body">How it Works</h1>

                <div class="pl-body">
                    <p>Payload indexes a special directory named `/posted`.
                    Everything you put in that directory gets listed on the
                    homepage of your payload installation.</p>

                    <h5>Payload has been built to be extendable.</h5>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Articles in the list are wrapped in semantic HTML,
                        ready for you to style with your own CSS.</li>

                        <li>Adding more content to the homepage is as easy as
                        editing a view &mdash; you don't even have to dirty your
                        hands with PHP.</li>

                        <li>Want to do more complex things like listing
                        thumbnails instead of just words? Payload was built on
                        codeigniter, so if you can write PHP, you can extend
                        Payload.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <br class="clear">

                        <h3>Behaviours</h3>

                        <p>For details on Payload's technical behaviours see
                        <em><a href="#you-should-know" title="">things you should know</a></em>.</p>

                        <h1>How to Use it</h1>

                        <p>Payload looks in /posted/ for your posts. It isn't limited to one post per subdirectory however; you can use subdirectories as categories, dividing up your posts manually. Here's an example:</p>
                    </div>

                    <br class="clear">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/3086155.js?file=directory_structure.txt"></script>

                    <p class="pl-body">That's a possible directory structure that would work with payload. Here's that directory structure in markup:</p>

                    <br class="clear">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/3086155.js?file=output.html"></script>

                    <p class="pl-body">You can see that the names of the categories are derived directly from their directory names, as are the post titles.</p>

                    <br class="clear">

                    <div class="pl-body">
                        <h2 id="you-should-know">You Should Know</h2>

                        <p>Payload is very new and because of that there is a
                        lot of stuff that may change. There are a few things
                        that you should be aware of before choosing to put your
                        data into the Payload system.</p>
                    </div>

                    <br class="clear">

                    <div class="pl-three-col">
                        <h4>Payload Mirrors</h4>
                        <p>Payload mirrors the /posted/ directory. Everything placed in there is public, so it's probably best if you don't go storing your passwords there.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="pl-three-col">
                        <h4>Payload is New</h4>
                        <p>Payload is very new and hasn't been tested a whole bunch. There will be bugs and some of them may be particularly nasty. I'm working to solve these, so if you come across one please contact <a href="">pl@ralphsaunders.co.uk</a> with the details.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="pl-three-col last">
                        <h4>Payload is Destructive</h4>
                        <p>Payload renames HTML files placed in the /posted/ directory to index.html. <em>All of them</em>.</p>
