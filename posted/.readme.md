# /posted/

This directory is where you should put articles you want to be publicly viewable
on the site. Uploaded __articles should be contained within their own
directories__.

## How it works

Let's say you upload an article to

    /posted/my-new-article/document name.html

This will map to the url

    example.com/posted/my-new-article/

Simple right?
